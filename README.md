first thing you should do is prolly install the requirements by doing "pip install requirements.txt"
and then after that make sure you put an appropriate api key for the [mistral ai](https://console.mistral.ai/)

of course you can probably switch out the code in mistral.py and edit it to use chatgpt or any other llm but i went for mistral ai because i personally like it

make sure your mic works if it doesnt work lmao (i learnt this the hard way)
