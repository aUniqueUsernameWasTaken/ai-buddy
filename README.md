# ai buddy
first thing you should do is prolly install the requirements by doing 
```py
pip install requirements.txt
```
and then after that make sure you put an appropriate api key for the [mistral ai](https://console.mistral.ai/) in the [mistral.py file](https://github.com/aUniqueUsernameWasTaken/ai-buddy/blob/master/mistral.py)

of course you can probably switch out the code in mistral.py and edit it to use chatgpt or any other llm but i went for mistral ai because i personally like it

make sure your mic works if it doesnt work lmao (i learnt this the hard way)
